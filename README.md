# Agentic Ontology

This repository contains the **Agentic Ontology (AgentO)**, a formal semantic model for representing agents, their capabilities, interactions, and execution structures (e.g., Agents, tasks, goal  and workflow patterns). The ontology is designed to support research and applications in agentic AI.

## üåê Ontology Overview

The ontology provides a structured vocabulary to represent:

- **Agents**: Entities capable of performing actions with autonomy.
- **Workflow**: Sequences or networks of actions or tasks, possibly with control flow (sequential, parallel, conditional).
- **Tasks & Tools**: Executable components that make up a plan, etc.

The model is suitable for integration with knowledge graphs, semantic reasoning engines, and agent-based modeling tools.
